# Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree (DSND) Term 2 Projects

## Overview

The Data Scientist Nanodegree (DSND) program is an advanced program designed to prepare learners
for data scientist jobs.  DSND Term 2 particularly emphasizes applied data science and therefore requires more comprehensive skills and techniques.  The evaluated learning length for Term 2 is 4 months. I applied the following skills in completing the projects:

- Use Python and SQL to access and analyze data from several different data sources.
- Use principles of statistics and probability to design and execute A/B tests and recommendation
  engines to assist businesses in making data-automated decisions.
- Build predictive models using a variety of machine learning techniques.
- Perform feature engineering to improve performance of machine learning models.
- Understand how to optimize, tune, and improve algorithms to improve run speed.
- Compare the performances of learned models using suitable metrics.
- Use cloud-based solutions to deploy a data science solution to a basic flask app.

## Projects

1. **Boston Airbnb Project:**
   - Choose a dataset, identify three questions, analyze and visualize the data.
   - Use machine learning technique to perform modeling and price prediction.
   - Create a GitHub repository and write a blog post to communicate my findings to the appropriate audience. 

2. **Disaster Response Pipelines Project:**
   - Build a data pipeline to prepare the message data from major natural disasters around the world.
   - Build a machine learning pipeline to categorize emergency text messages.
   - Create a web app to visualize the message classification and graphs.

3. **IBM Recommendation Engine:**
   - Create recommendation engines using common techniques such as rank-based recommendation, collaborative filtering and matrix factorization, using real data in Python
   - Interpret the results of matrix factorization to better understand latent features of customer data

4. **Capstone Project - Dog Breed Classification:**
   - Use OpenCV's classifier to detect human faces
   - Pre-process the data for CNN architecture
   - Build a CNN from scratch to predict the dogs' breeds
   - Use, compare and optimize 5 CNN models for transfer learning by Keras
   - Write and test my algorithm based on the optimum CNN model selected to classify dog breeds
